|00| not important | no tracking car, urban environment |
|01| could be important | a few car moves from opposite direction |
|02| could be important | a lot of car moves from opposite direction |
|03| less interesting |  one moving car but couldn't track over time|
|04| not important | one moving car but couldn't track over time, might be interesting |
|05| most important | cars move in many direction, NOT SURE THIS |
|06| not interesting | lots of car but cannot track over time|
|07| interesting | one or two opposite direction cars, at the end of seq|
|08| not interesting| lots of car but cannot track over time|
|09| interesting | one moving cars, THIS|
|10| interesting | one moving cars, THIS|
|11| less interesting| ego-car parks at an intersection and be able to observe twos orthogonal moving cars|
|12|interesting| lot of oppsosite direction cars but can track for a few frames|
|13|interesting| two or three moving cars|
|14|no moving car||
|15|one leading car| might be one|
|16|one leading car|use this and remove humans and check ground truth, THIS|
|17|less inrestering leading car| opposite direct car|
|18|could be important| cars on the opposite side of the road|
|19|could be important| ego-car tunrs left|
|20|could be important| detected one car moving in opposite direction for 6 frames|
|21| important | one car is turning, could be a good example, THIS|
|22|nothing interesting| |
|23|nothing interesting| one car turns at an intersection |
|24|nothing interesting| |
|25|nothing interesting| no moving car here|
|26|interesting| this is a good example of how bbox are bad|
|27|could be important| one moving car at the end of seq|
|28|could be important| detection fails on the car|
|29|important| one moving car at the end of seq|
|30|important| one moving car and turning|
|31|interesting | lot of cars, overtake one car but it doesn't move, THIS |
|32|could be important | lot of cars, detection fails on the car |
|33|important | lot of cars |
|34|could be important | lot of cars |
|35|important | one or two cars moving in opposite direction |
|36|could be important | because all cars all are standing still |
|37|could be important  | but deteciton failed |
|38| important | parking cars for this is a good example of how bbox are bad |
|39| important | This is the best one. THIS |
|40| not important | no cars in this scene |
|41| could be important | parking at intersection  a good example of how bbox are bad|
|42| could be important  | a good example of how bbox are bad |
|43| important, not sure  | like silom road |
|44| could be important  | detected car at the end of seq |
|45| important  | lots of cars of detected cars, kiss-icp or gt might fail here |
|46| important  | lots of cars, something fail here because gt does not perfectly alging with point cloud |
|47| important  | lots of cars but they are parking cars |
|48| important  | no moving cars in the first half adn moving in the second half, 3D detection couldn't detect the turning cars. |
|49| very important  | lots of cars |
